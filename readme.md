# Hireath

Hiraeth is an atmospheric 3D fps platformer game where your goal is to speedrun through dreamscapes. Dash, slide, wallrun, and bunny hop your way through surreal environments to secure a gold medal on each level and escape virtual purgatory. 

This project was created during the spring quater of UCSB ECE184 - Introduction to Video Game Development.
